    "# Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you'll implement a basic search engine by defining your own Python classes. A **search engine** is an algorithm that takes a query and retrieves the most relevant documents for that query. In order to identify the most relevant documents, our search engine will use **term frequency–inverse document frequency** ([tf–idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)), an information statistic for determining the relevance of a term to each document from a corpus consisting of many documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tf–idf statistic** is a product of two values: term frequency and inverse document frequency. **Term frequency** computes the number of times that a term appears in a **document** (such as a single Wikipedia page). If we were to use only the term frequency in determining the relevance of a term to each document, then our search result might not be helpful since most documents contain many common words such as \"the\" or \"a\". In order to downweight these common terms, the **document frequency** computes the number of times that a term appears across the **corpus** of all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the `doggos` and `small_wiki` directories to be copied to your work area in the same folder. You do not need to submit these folders but should submit this notebook file after `Run All` and saved."

    "1. An initializer that takes a `str` path and initializes the document data based on the text in the specified file. Assume that the file exists, but that it could be empty. In order to implement `term_frequency` later, we'll need to precompute and save the term frequency for each term in the document in the initializer as a field by constructing a dictionary that maps each `str` term to its `float` term frequency. Term frequency is defined as *the count of the given term* divided by *the total number of words in the text*.\n",
    "> Consider the term frequencies for this document containing 4 total words: \"the cutest cutest dog\".\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - \"the\" appears 1 time out of 4 total words, so its term frequency is 0.25.\n",
    "> - \"cutest\" appears 2 times out of 4 total words, so its term frequency is 0.5.\n",
    "> - \"dog\" appears 1 time out of 4 total words, so its term frequency is 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When constructing this dictionary, call the `clean` function to convert the input token to lowercase and ignore non-letter characters so that \"corgi\", \"CoRgi\", and \"corgi!!\" are all considered the same string \"corgi\" to the search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A method `term_frequency` that takes a given `str` term and returns its term frequency by looking it up in the precomputed dictionary. Remember to normalize the term before looking it up to find the corresponding match. If the term does not occur, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A method `get_path` that returns the `str` path of the file that this document represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A method `get_words` that returns a `set` of the unique, cleaned words in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A method `__repr__` that returns a string representation of this document in the format `Document('{path}')` (with literal single quotes in the output) where `{path}` is the path to the document from the initializer. The `__repr__` method is called when Jupyter Notebook needs to display a `Document` as output, so we should be able to copy the string contents into a new code cell and immediately run it to create a new `Document`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each of the 4 methods (excluding the initializer) in the `Document` class, write a testing function that contains at least 3 `pytest`-style assertions based on your own testing corpus and written as expressions like 1 / 5 that show your thinking**. As always, your test cases should expand the domain and range. Documentation strings are optional for testing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We've provided some example corpuses in the `doggos` directory and the `small_wiki` directory. For this task, create your own testing corpus by creating a **New Folder** and adding your own text files to it.\n",
    "- Be sure to exhaustively test your `Document` class before moving on: bugs in `Document` will make implementing the following `SearchEngine` task much more difficult.\n",
    "- Line numbers reported in error messages will be off by one due to the first line of code required to run `%%ipytest`. Look below the indicated line. Line comments (lines that begin `#`) may also result in different line numbering."
