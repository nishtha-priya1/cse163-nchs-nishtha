    "Earlier, we wrote a `University` class that needed to loop over all the students enrolled in the university in order to compute the list of students enrolled in a particular class. Let's take this opportunity to review this by also introducing one neat feature of Python that allows you to define simple data types called **data classes**. We can define a `Student` data class that takes a `str` name and `dict[str, int]` for courses and the credits for each course with the `@dataclass` **decorator**. Decorators will turn out to be a useful feature for the remainder of this lesson, and it's helpful to see them in a more familiar context first."
